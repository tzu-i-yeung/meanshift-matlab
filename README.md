All the images in this repository come from the [Berkeley Segmentation Dataset (BSDS300)](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/bsds/).

The implementation takes inspiration from the paper ["Contour detection and hierarchical image segmentation"](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~malik/papers/arbelaezMFM-pami2010.pdf) by Arbelaez *et al.*
